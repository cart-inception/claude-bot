The UPS power module includes a lithium battery protection circuit, offering functions such as
overcharging, over-discharging, overcurrent, and short-circuit protection.
The sample code is developed using Arduino IDE, eliminating the need for manual configuration of
the compilation environment. Upon startup, the ESP32 automatically establishes a WIFI hotspot.
Users can connect and log in to the control interface using a smartphone (Android/iOS) or a
computer (Linux/Windows/Mac) with any Chromium-based browser, without requiring an app
download.
The slave ESP32 can be used to drive DC motors and serial bus servos, onboard interface for OLED
screens, TF card slots, a nine-axis IMU module, WiFi, and Bluetooth. Even without installing an
upper-level device, it can be used independently.
The system can be extended with various host devices, using serial communication to transmit
control data in JSON format.
The entire code is open-source and comes with online rich development documentation and
tutorials.
The open-source resource includes planar drawings and chassis structural drawings, including 3D
models, facilitating secondary development.
JSON commands can be sent via serial port, USB, HTTP, ESP-NOW, etc.
Most of the configuration settings can be realized by JSON commands, for example, you can
configure WIFI connection for the product without connecting the USB cable.

Firmware Updates
If your WAVE ROVER displays "Version: 0.9" on the OLED screen when booting up, it indicates that
the driver software on WAVE ROVER is already updated to the new version, and there is no need to
execute this section for product updating.
If your WAVE ROVER boots up without displaying "Version: 0.9" on the OLED screen, it means that
the driver software on the product is still the old version, and you need to execute this section to
update the product. If you need to restore factory settings, you can also do so through this section.
We provide an ESP32 download tool for WAVE ROVER, which can help users quickly update product

The web interface will display the robot's voltage, WIFI signal strength (STA mode), heading angle, IP
and MAC address, and other information in real-time.
The movement of the robot can be controlled by the direction button, and the SLOW, MIDDLE, and
FAST buttons below the direction buttons are used to select the moving speed of the robot.
In the FEEDBACK INFOMATION window you can send JSON commands to the robot, here are the
specific JSON commands.
The web page includes "heartbeat detection". After opening the web control interface, the web
application will communicate with the robot continuously. If the connection is disconnected during
the movement of the robot, the robot will automatically stop moving in a short time to avoid
danger.
As the web application is completely open-source, you can change its interface and functions by
changing WebPage.h. You can follow the customizable development tutorial we provide to learn.

The specific content in the JSON command input window:
{"T":404,"ap_ssid":"UGV","ap_password":"12345678","sta_ssid":"your_ssid","sta_password":"password"}
Replace your_ssid as your known WIFI, and so as the password, and please do not delete the
double quotation marks.
Click on "SEND" after modification, and wait for the product to connect. If it successfully
connects to your known WIFI, the OLED screen will display the IP address assigned to robot by
the router on the "ST" line.
Once connected successfully, the robot will automatically save this WiFi configuration. In the
future, unless you need to change the known WiFi network, you do not need to repeat the
above steps for configuration. The robot will automatically connect to the known WiFi network
after booting up.
You can access the robot's Web control page by opening the Google Chrome browser on other
devices within the same local network and entering the IP address of the robot's "ST" mode. You can
also control the robot through JSON commands using a simple Python script by sending HTTP
requests.

WAVE ROVER's JSON Instruction Interaction Tutorial
What Is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that is
easy for humans to read and write and can exchange data between multiple languages. It is also easy
for machines to parse and generate.

Why Interact With WAVE ROVER Using JSON Commands?
As WAVE ROVER boasts more onboard resources, rich demo functions, and easy to connect to
external host computers, it is easily controlled by the host computer in more aspects. Hence, we can
use JSON commands to interact with WAVE ROVER. Also, we can customize these functions based on
the current framework to make them more suitable for your needs.

JSON Commands Communication Methods
You can use the following demos to control the robot's functions by sending JSON commands in
different ways.
The robot has a built-in heartbeat function: if no new movement control command is issued within 3
seconds, the robot will automatically stop moving. Therefore, when controlling the robot through
the host, you need to repeatedly issue movement commands at regular intervals to keep the robot
moving continuously.

Issue JSON Commands via the Web Application
After powering on, use your smartphone or computer to connect to the robot's WiFi network named
"UGV" with the password "12345678". Once connected to the WiFi, open the Google Chrome
browser and type "192.168.4.1" in the address bar to access the web-based user interface.
Send JSON command to the robot on the FEEDBACK INFORMATION window. For more details, you
can refer to #JSON Command Set.

Issue JSON Commands Over HTTP Using Python Scripts
Click to download http_simple_ctrl.py (https://files.waveshare.com/upload/5/51/Http_simple_ctrl.zip)
, as shown below:
import requests
import argparse

def main():
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Http JSON Communication')
parser.add_argument('ip', type=str, help='IP address: 192.168.10.104')
args = parser.parse_args()
ip_addr = args.ip
try:
while True:
command = input("input your json cmd: ")
url = "http://" + ip_addr + "/js?json=" + command
response = requests.get(url)
content = response.text
print(content)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
main()

Before running the demo, you need to confirm the IP address of the robot. The IP address of the
robot is closely related to its WiFi mode.
If the robot's WIFI mode is only in AP mode, the IP address is 192.168.4.1.
If the robot's WIFI mode is in STA mode, you can get the IP address of the WAVGO on the OLED
screen.
Run the HTTP request communication demo by the following command, and change the IP address
of the command to your robot's IP address.
python http_simple_ctrl.py 192.168.4.1

https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/WAVE_ROVER

Note: In either mode, the robot needs to be on the same LAN as the device on which this script is
running.

Issue JSON Commands Using ESP-NOW
You can control the robot driver board to send commands to another driver board through ESPNOW, which features connection-free low latency and supports unicast, multicast and broadcast
communication.
To test it easily, the default ESP-NOW mode after booting up can receive the ESPP-NOW commands.
If you do not want this product to be controlled by other devices, you can use {"T":301,"mode":0}
command to turn off the ESP-NOW receiving function, and you can restore it by {"T":301,"mode":3}
later.
If you need the product to automatically set to {"T":301,"mode":0} every time you turn it on, you can
write this command to boot.mission file. So that the product will automatically turn off the ESPNOW command receiving function every time the product is turned on, you can use this command
to add {"T":301,"mode":0} to boot.mission:{"T":222,"name":"boot", "step":"{\"T\":301,\"mode\":0}"},
and follow it up if you want to cancel this setting you can just delete the boot.mission file (after
deleting it, it will be automatically created on the next boot): {"T":203,"name":"boot.mission"}.
ESP-NOW Usage Preparation
In the following tutorials for using ESP-NOW, the receiving of JSON commands on the receiving end
assumes that you have enabled the command-receiving function of ESP-NOW (the default state of a
new product is sufficient).
The hardware involved in the following functions are ESP32 devices such as General Driver for
Robots or ROS Driver for Robots, which are running our slave demos.
Unicast Control
Unicast control is point-to-point control, and you can control one device through another device.
Users need to get the MAC address of the controlled terminal, and this address usually displays on
the OLED screen.
Users can send the JSON commands to the control terminal, and add the MAC address of the
controlled terminal to the peer. For example, {"T":303,"mac":"CC:DB:A7:5C:1C:40"}, and you need to
replace the value of mac with the mac address of your slave.
If you need to delete some mac address from the peer, you can use
{"T":304,"mac":"CC:DB:A7:5C:1C:40"} command.
Send JSON command to the controlled terminal:
{"T":306,"mac":"CC:DB:A7:5C:1C:40","dev":0,"b":0,"s":0,"e":0,"h":0,"cmd":1,"megs":"{"T":114,"led":255}"}
You can replace the JSON command of megs above with other commands, and replace the mac
value with the mac address of your controlled terminal. Do not change other values as these values
are for other functions.
Broadcast Control
Broadcast control is a one-to-many control method where you can control multiple devices at the
same time from one device.
The user does not need to obtain the MAC address of the controlled terminal, this mode will send
commands to all devices within a certain range, the method of broadcast control is the same as that
of unicast control, only the mac value in unicast control needs to be replaced with the broadcast

2/4/2025, 10:41 AM

WAVE ROVER - Waveshare Wiki

9 of 16

https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/WAVE_ROVER

address: "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"
The user adds the broadcast address to the peer by sending a JSON command to the console using
the method described in this tutorial: {"T":303, "mac": "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"}
If you need to delete the broadcast address from the peer, you can use
{"T":304,"mac":"FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"} command.
The broadcast sends JSON command:
{"T":306,"mac":"FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF","dev":0,"b":0,"s":0,"e":0,"h":0,"cmd":1,"megs":"{"T":114,"led":255}"}
You can replace the JSON commands in the megs above above with other commands and
leave the rest of the values unchanged, those values are used for other functions.
Multicast Control
Multicast control is a one-to-many control method where you can control multiple devices at the
same time from a single device. The difference with broadcast control is that multicast control allows
you to select the device being controlled.
Users need to get the MAC address on the controlled terminal, and this address usually displays on
the OLED screen.
Users can send the JSON commands to the control terminal, and add the MAC address of the
controlled terminal to peer, for example, {"T":303,"mac":"CC:DB:A7:5C:1C:40"},
{"T":304,"mac":"CC:DB:A7:5C:E5:FC"}. You need to replace the value of mac with the mac address of
your slave. Also, you can add multiple mac addresses of the controlled terminal, but it is
recommended that you do not add more than 20.
Do not add the broadcast address "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF".
If you need to delete the broadcast mac address from the peer, you can use
{"T":304,"mac":"FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"} command.
The multicast sends the JSON command:
{"T":305,"dev":0,"b":0,"s":0,"e":1.57,"h":1.57,"cmd":1,"megs":"{"T":114,"led":255}"}
You can replace the JSON command in the megs above with other commands, and leave the rest of
the values unchanged, those values are used for other functions.

Issue JSON Commands Using GPIO or USB Serial Port
You can use a PC, Raspberry Pi, Jeston Nano, Jetson Orin Nano, and other hosts to communicate with
the ESP32 slave through the serial port. There are two methods for serial port connection as follows:
Connects the robot to the Raspberry Pi, Jeston Nano or Jetson Orin Nano via a 40PIN UART
interface.
Connect the USB port of the robot's slave drive board to the host via a USB cable (this method
requires disassembly of the robot).
Click on serial_simple_ctrl.py (https://files.waveshare.com/upload/5/51/Serial_simple_ctrl.zip), as
shown below:
